# Car-price-Prediction-Using-Polynomial-Regression

I created a model that predicts used Audi cars prices using python scikit learn package.

I tried the multiple linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression and Polynomial regression.

The Polynomial regression model was the best as it had the highest accuracy, an R2 Score of 0.92
